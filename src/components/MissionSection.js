      <div className={styles.section}>Bikeable Santa Rosa is an all-volunteer group of Santa Rosa residents.<br />
      Our mission is to catalyze the rapid completion of a safe and low-stress bicycle network connecting all neighborhoods in Santa Rosa. Using bikes for transportation is a healthy, eco-friendly, community-friendly option. With protected bike lanes, bike-safe intersection design, and other low-cost measures, the city can create bicycle routes that are safe and welcoming for users of all ages and abilities. A complete and connected network will allow people to get wherever they need to go in the city by bike.<br/><br/></div>
