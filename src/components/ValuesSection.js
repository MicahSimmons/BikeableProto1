      <h1>Values</h1>

      <h2>Empowering and protecting youth and other non-driving residents.</h2>
      <div className={styles.section}>Right now, a significant portion of Santa Rosa’s population cannot drive, either because they are too young, or not physically, economically, or legally able to drive. Safe, welcoming bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure would allow most of these residents to get to where they need to go on a daily basis, freeing them to move comfortably and affordably around the city.<br/><br/></div>

      <h2>Helping families meet their transportation needs.</h2>
      <div className={styles.section}>Many Santa Rosa parents do not feel it is safe to let their children and teens ride to and from school, extracurricular activities, and social events. This places a significant burden on Santa Rosa parents, who must factor chauffeuring duties into their already busy lives. More importantly, it burdens and constrains our youth, whose options and opportunities are limited by their family’s ability to get them around. These burdens are not experienced equitably. Financially constrained households are more likely to have parents that are employed full time in non-flexible jobs, limiting their capacity to assist their kids with transportation. Financially constrained households also tend to have fewer and less reliable cars, compounding transportation difficulties. <br/><br/></div>
      
      <h2>Supporting eco-friendly options for transportation.</h2>
      <div className={styles.section}>Recently, both the city of Santa Rosa and the County of Sonoma have passed climate emergency resolutions, committing to reducing our greenhouse gas emissions and helping our population transition to modes of transportation that do not contribute to climate disruption. However, research from around the country shows that only about 2 -3 % of adults are willing to ride on roads like those in Santa Rosa. Another group of riders -- ‘the curious but concerned’ are happy to ride if they are given dedicated and protected lanes. This means that if the city hopes to achieve its goal of getting 10% of the population to travel by bike, it must invest in changing the design of our roads. In addition to climate benefits, every person who is on a bike takes up less room on the street, reduces congestion, decreases parking demand, and decreases air pollution. Bicycle infrastructure is less expensive to install and maintain than car infrastructure. And bicycling also promotes healthy exercise. The city should do everything in its power to support and encourage those who are interested in using bikes for transportation.<br/><br/></div>
      
      <h2>Decreasing traffic collisions of all types.</h2>
      <div className={styles.section}>Recently, both the city of Santa Rosa and the County of Sonoma have engaged in a Vision Zero plan that seeks to address our high rates of traffic collisions, and related injuries and deaths. The most current research from traffic engineers shows that dedicated bicycle infrastructure and traffic calming measures are some of the most effective tools for making the roads safer.<br/><br/></div>
      
      <h2>Building friendlier, healthier, and more connected communities.</h2>
      <div className={styles.section}>The AARP (American Association of Retired Persons) has compiled a helpful list of the 10 ways that better bicycle infrastructure benefits those who never get on their bikes at all, including reduced noise, cleaner air, a friendlier community vibe, and savings to taxpayers. A bikeable Santa Rosa is a livable Santa Rosa.<br/><br/></div>
      
      <h2>Having fun!</h2>
      <div className={styles.section}>We believe JOY and CONNECTION and COMMUNITY should be a daily part of life. Our campaign for a bikeable Santa Rosa welcomes everyone who wants to help make our city less stressful and more fun!<br/><br/></div>
